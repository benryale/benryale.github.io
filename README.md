Post mortem:

The biggest struggle with this project was my poor ability to temper expectations and accurately gauge how far away my goals for the project truly were. I am happy with the result, But I am deeply unsatisfied my larger ambitions for th projct. The project ended as a cabale foundation for many multiscreened or multiapp games to be potentially built in it in the future. It is designed to be an extremely mutable base OS. 

I would have preferred to have actually completed the game I set out to create, but it was a good lesson that things are further away than they seem. On the other hand, learning how to readjust the project expectations was a valuable learning experience. 

I would like to finish the peices of the engine that are not properly mutable and clean up the less propper parts of the engine so that I can begin work on the actual game, but I am very proud of where the engine is now.
